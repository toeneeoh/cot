## Curse of Time RPG: Nevermore
https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/curse-of-time-rpg-nevermore-v1-35c.294239/

Curse of Time is a RPG series built in Warcraft III almost two decades ago (2005). The source code / map file has been passed down from several owners / groups of people who have made their own versions and updates to the game and it has now been left to me and [@TastyTastyToast](https://github.com/TastyTastyToast).

The original code is written in Blizzard's JASS language developed for their World Editor, which is quite outdated and lacking in features. Many third party extensions such as vJASS were developed by others to improve the modding experience and are used in CoT (some with modification) which are available at https://www.hiveworkshop.com/.

12/22/23 - vJass development is now ceased in favor of Lua, with transpiling made possible due to the assistance of vJass2Lua by Bribe: https://bribefromthehive.github.io/vJass2Lua/
