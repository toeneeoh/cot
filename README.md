Curse of Time is a RPG series built in Warcraft III almost two decades ago (2005). The game has been passed down to several owners / groups of people who have created their own spins on the series and now it has been left to me and another collaborator.

The majority of the code is written in Blizzard's JASS language they developed for their World Editor, which is quite outdated and lacking in basic features. Many third party extensions such as vJASS were developed by others to improve the modding experience by adding object-oriented functionality as well as syntax highlighters. Several libraries used in CoT are written by others (some with modification) and are available to the public on https://www.hiveworkshop.com/.

I began working on this game in 2018 and have continued to update and improve the code base from the poor state that it used to be. This is the uncompiled war3map.j file split into broad categories.
