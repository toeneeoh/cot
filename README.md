Curse of Time is a RPG series built in Warcraft III almost two decades ago (2005). The game has been passed down to several owners / groups of people who have created their own spins on the series and now it has been left to me and another collaborator.

The majority of the code is written in Blizzard's JASS language they developed for their World Editor, which is quite outdated and lacking in features. Many third party extensions such as vJASS were developed by others to add object-oriented features and also several public libraries and code snippets are used with the intention of making a better game.

I began working on this game in 2018 and have attempted to maintain it from the poor state that it used to be. This is the uncompiled main script file split into event based categories.
