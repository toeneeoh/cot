Curse of Time is a RPG series built in Warcraft III almost two decades ago (2005). The game has been passed down to several owners / groups of people who have created their own spins on the series and now it has been left to me and another collaborator.

The original code is written in Blizzard's JASS language developed for their World Editor, which is quite outdated and lacking in features. Many third party extensions such as vJASS were developed by others to improve the modding experience and are used in CoT (some with modification) which are available at https://www.hiveworkshop.com/.

As of 12/22/23 vJass development is now ceased in favor of Lua, as transpiling was made possible due to the assistance of a tool by Bribe at https://bribefromthehive.github.io/vJass2Lua/
